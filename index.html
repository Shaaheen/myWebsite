    <p> Hi :) I'm Shaaheen. This is my website, I created it to try and showcase some of my work online <br/>
        but mostly just to try learn some web dev skills. I plan to add some really random stuff here just to learn as <br />
        as much as I can with websites.<br /> <br />
        I'm currently studying Computer Science and Business Science at the University of Cape Town and am very <br />
        interested in Internships for University vacations. If you're looking for Interns, please feel free to look over my CV below :)<br />
        and contact me at  <a href="mailto:sacoorshaheen@gmail.com">sacoorshaheen@gmail.com</a> .
